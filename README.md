# Song-Recommender-project
In this project, we have developed a song recommender system that utilizes clustering algorithms to suggest songs to users based on their preferences. This recommendation system is designed to assist users in discovering new music that aligns with their tastes and interests.

Key Features:

Clustering Algorithms: We have implemented various clustering algorithms such as K-Means and DBSCAN to group similar songs together based on their features.

Personalized Recommendations: By analyzing the user's favorite songs and their characteristics, our system generates personalized recommendations tailored to individual preferences.

Interactive User Interface: Our system provides an intuitive interface where users can input their favorite songs or explore curated playlists to discover new music effortlessly.

Accuracy and Performance: We have optimized our recommendation algorithms to ensure accurate predictions and efficient performance, allowing for seamless user experience.

How It Works:

Input Favorite Songs: Users can input their favorite songs into the system either by searching for specific tracks or selecting from curated playlists.

Clustering Analysis: Our system analyzes the audio features of the input songs, such as tempo, energy, and danceability, to group them into clusters of similar songs.

Personalized Recommendations: Based on the identified clusters and the user's preferences, our system generates personalized song recommendations that closely match the user's music taste.

Explore and Discover: Users can explore the recommended songs, listen to previews, and add them to their playlists for future enjoyment. Additionally, they can provide feedback on the recommendations to further refine their preferences.
